A twitter bot, shows current bitcoin price every hour, with a automatically generated image.

Visit the [Bot's twitter account](https://twitter.com/bbtcguru)

**Reliabilities:** [CoinAPI](https://www.coinapi.io/) for collecting current bitcoin price, [`tweepy`](https://pypi.org/project/tweepy/) as interphase to the twitter API, [`schedule`](https://pypi.org/project/schedule/) for scheduling tweets, [`pillow`](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) for generating tweet images.

**Note:** This repository does not hold all the code used in the bot other than different unpublishable tokens, secrets, keys etc. So the repository is not going to run.
